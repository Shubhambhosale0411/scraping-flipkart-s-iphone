# scraping-flipkart-s-iphone
This project focuses on Web Scraping and Data Cleaning. The website chosen for this project was Darty, more specifically the category of washing machines. The purpose was to use the library BeautifulSoup to extract the information required, clean the data and export it to a MySQL table. Each stage was condensed in a function that was later included in a pipeline to make the code easier to read and to run.
